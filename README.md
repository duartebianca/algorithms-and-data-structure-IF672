# ðŸ§  Algorithms and Data Structure Repository - IF672

This repository serves as a personal collection for the IF672 Algorithms and Data Structures course at CIn-UFPE. It contains various categories of content related to the course.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

- **PureAlgos:** Implementation of pure algorithms.
  
- **APs (Practical Activities):** Direct assignments from the Google Classroom.
  
- **EPs (Exercise Practices):** Exercises based on the Practical Activities in Portuguese, with solutions.
  
- **MindMaps:** Visual representations in the form of mind maps, derived from the course textbooks.
  
- **LE (Exercises Lists):** Lists created on Vjudge. Each list has a dedicated folder with solutions and a PDF containing the questions.
  
- **EE (School Exercise):** Materials related to school exercises, including exam-related content.
